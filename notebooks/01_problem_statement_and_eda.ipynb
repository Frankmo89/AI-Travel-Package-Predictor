    "\n",
    "1. **NO AI TOOLS**: You may **NOT** use ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, or any other AI assistant to generate code for this assignment. The goal is to build *your* fundamental skills. If you rely on AI now, the advanced topics later will be impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Study Groups Encouraged**: You **ARE** encouraged to discuss ideas, share approaches, and explain concepts to your study group peers. Teaching others is the best way to learn! However, the code you submit must be **your own work**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Your Resources**: You are free to use Google, StackOverflow, Pandas/Scikit-learn documentation, and your class notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comment Your Code**: Include comments explaining *why* you're doing what you're doing. I want to see your thought process.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Resubmission**: You may submit this assignment multiple times for feedback before each checkpoint deadline.\n",

    "## Important: Written Reflections\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, you'll see text cells asking you to explain your decisions, observations, and reasoning. **These written reflections are a critical part of your grade.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't just write one-word answers or skip these sections. Your reflections demonstrate:\n",
    "- Your understanding of the data science process\n",
    "- Your ability to communicate findings to stakeholders\n",
    "- Your critical thinking about data quality and feature importance\n",

    "Take time to write thoughtful, complete responses. This is what separates a good data scientist from someone who just runs code!\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1.1 What are you trying to predict?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Clearly state your target variable and what it represents.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "I am trying  to predict the cost of a single travel package for one individual. This is a continuous numerical variable that represents the final price a customer pay based on the trip´s features ( such as destination, hotel quality , and flight details).\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: Travel prices fluctuate significantly based on complex factors like seasonality, airline availability, and hotel ratings. it is difficult for travel agencies to provide instant, accurate price estimates without time-consuming manual calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: My project solves this by building a Machine Learning model(Regression) that predicts the price per person based on the trip´s details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Why does this prediction matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Who would care about this prediction? What decisions could be made with it?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1: Travel agencies, tour operators , and online booking platforms are the primary users who would care about this prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2: Decisions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Automated Pricing: The model allows agencies to instantly price complex package without manual effort, reducing customers wait times. \n",
    "\n",
    "Revenue Optimization: It helps decision-makers avoid underpricing ( losing margin) or overpricing ( losing sales) by grounding prices in historical marker data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inventory Planning: By understanding which features ( like airline or hotel type) drive prices up, companies can design better package that maximize profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 What features might help predict the target?\n",
    "\n",
    "*Based on your intuition and domain knowledge, what columns do you think will be most important?*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on domain knowledge, the following features are likely to be the strong predictors of Per Person Price:\n",
    "\n",
    "Package Type: This is likely the strongest predictor: A Luxury or Premium tag implies 5-stars hotels and better services, drastically increasing the price compared to Budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "Destination: Location determines base costs. Popular or remote destinations often have higher logistical costs than common routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fight Stops: The number of stops (0, 1, or 2) serves as a proxy for flight convenience and cost. Direct fligths are usually more expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Airline: The carrier type( Full service vs Low cost) directly correlates with the ticket portion of the package price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Itinerary (Duration): While not a direct column, the length of the itinerary ( number of day/nigths) will have a linear relationship with cost-more days equal higher prices."

    "Next, I looked at the distribution. I noticed that the mean price is about 20,059, but the median is lower at 17,765. Since the mean is higher than the median, I know the data is skewed to the right.\n",

This visually confirms that the data is right-skewed, meaning most packages are affordable, but a few are extremely expensive.\n",

    "Finally, I noted the skewness score of 2.56. Since this number is well above 0, it proves the data is highly skewed. This tells me that I should apply a log transformation in the future feature engineering step to make the data more normal, which will help my linear regression model perform better."
